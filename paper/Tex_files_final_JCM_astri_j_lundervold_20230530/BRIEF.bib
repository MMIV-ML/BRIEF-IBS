  abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS
There have been few Asian studies regarding anxiety and depression associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency and importance of anxiety and depression in Korean patients with IBS.


METHODS
A total of 124 IBS patients and 91 healthy subjects were enrolled consecutively. All participants were asked to complete self-administered questionnaires: one addressing symptom severity, the Short Form 36, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The patients were also asked to complete the IBS-specific quality of life (IBS-QOL) questionnaire.


RESULTS
Anxiety and depression were observed in 38.6% and 38.6% of IBS patients, respectively, and in 24.2% and 16.5% of healthy subjects, respectively (p<0.05 for both). The mean HADS scores for anxiety and depression in IBS patients were 6.8±4.5 and 7.1±4.4, respectively. Both anxiety and depression were associated with self-reported symptom severity (p<0.012 and p<0.001, respectively). As determined by multivariate analysis, symptom severity was the most important factor in the prediction of anxiety and depression. Self-reported symptom severity and depression were clearly and independently associated with the overall IBS-QOL score.


CONCLUSIONS
Anxiety and depression were frequently observed in Korean IBS patients and were related to the severity of their symptoms and the impairment of the patient's QOL. Our data suggest that assessing anxiety and depression is important when evaluating IBS patients.},

  abstract = {Background: Psychological factors have been prominently implicated in the causation as well as maintenance of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Studies comparing psychiatric morbidity in IBS with healthy controls have reported contrasting findings. The current study was undertaken to assess the prevalence of anxiety and depression in patients with IBS in comparison to healthy controls and to explore the relationship, if any, of anxiety and depression with various subtypes of IBS. Materials and Methods: Fifty consecutive patients of IBS (diagnosed as per Rome III criteria) between 18 and 65 years of age and fifty age- and sex-matched healthy controls were assessed for the presence of anxiety and depression using Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAMA) and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD), respectively. Results: The patient group scored higher than controls (P < 0.001) in both HAMA and HAMD scores. The HAMA scores were significantly higher (P < 0.001) in the severe IBS group compared to those with moderate IBS. HAMA scores predicted 25.6\% (R2 = 0.256) of variance in IBS severity scores. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of HAMD scores. Conclusion: The high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities such as anxiety and depression in IBS samples in our study provides evidence in favor of proper screening for these disorders in gastrointestinal clinics. Recognition and treatment for these comorbidities can improve the quality of life as well as overall outcomes.},

  abstract = {Supplemental Digital Content is Available in the Text. Women with irritable bowel syndrome often report fatigue, along with abdominal pain and psychological distress (i.e., depression and anxiety). There is little information about the relationships among these symptoms. Using a secondary data analysis (N = 356), we examined the relationship between abdominal pain and fatigue and whether psychological distress mediates the effect of abdominal pain on fatigue in both across women and within woman with irritable bowel syndrome. Data gathered through a 28-day diary were analyzed with linear regressions. The across-women and within-woman relationships among same-day abdominal pain, fatigue, and psychological distress were examined. Within-woman relationships were also examined for directionality among symptoms (i.e., prior-day abdominal pain predicts next-day fatigue and prior-day fatigue predicts next-day abdominal pain). In across-women and within-woman analyses on the same day, abdominal pain and fatigue were positively correlated. In within-woman analyses, abdominal pain predicted next-day fatigue, but fatigue did not predict next-day pain. In across-women and within-woman analyses, psychological distress partially mediated the effects of abdominal pain on fatigue. Symptom management incorporating strategies to decrease both abdominal pain and psychological distress are likely to reduce fatigue. Nursing interventions, such as self-management skills to reduce abdominal pain and psychological distress, may have the added benefit of reducing fatigue in irritable bowel syndrome.},

  abstract        = {Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder of brain-gut interactions characterized by chronic abdominal pain, altered bowel movements, often accompanied by somatic and psychiatric comorbidities. We aimed to test the hypothesis that a baseline phenotype composed of multi-modal neuroimaging and clinical features predicts clinical improvement on the IBS Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-SSS) at 3 and 12 months without any targeted intervention. Female participants (N = 60) were identified as "improvers" (50-point decrease on IBS-SSS from baseline) or "non-improvers." Data integration analysis using latent components (DIABLO) was applied to a training and test dataset to determine whether a limited number of sets of multiple correlated baseline'omics data types, including brain morphometry, anatomical connectivity, resting-state functional connectivity, and clinical features could accurately predict improver status. The derived predictive models predicted improvement status at 3-months and 12-months with 91% and 83% accuracy, respectively. Across both time points, non-improvers were classified as having greater correlated morphometry, anatomical connectivity and resting-state functional connectivity characteristics within salience and sensorimotor networks associated with greater pain unpleasantness, but lower default mode network integrity and connectivity. This suggests that non-improvers have a greater engagement of attentional systems to perseverate on painful visceral stimuli, predicting IBS exacerbation. The ability of baseline multimodal brain-clinical signatures to predict symptom trajectories may have implications in guiding integrative treatment in the age of precision medicine, such as treatments targeted at changing attentional systems such as mindfulness or cognitive behavioral therapy.},

  abstract        = {Preclinical evidence has firmly established bidirectional interactions among the brain, the gut, and the gut microbiome. Candidate signaling molecules and at least three communication channels have been identified. Communication within this system is nonlinear, is bidirectional with multiple feedback loops, and likely involves interactions between different channels. Alterations in gut-brain-microbiome interactions have been identified in rodent models of several digestive, psychiatric, and neurological disorders. While alterations in gut-brain interactions have clearly been established in irritable bowel syndrome, a causative role of the microbiome in irritable bowel syndrome remains to be determined. In the absence of specific microbial targets for more effective therapies, current approaches are limited to dietary interventions and centrally targeted pharmacological and behavioral approaches. A more comprehensive understanding of causative influences within the gut-brain-microbiome system and well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to translate these exciting preclinical findings into effective therapies.},

Data are then presented from several of our studies to support the following statements: (1) the examination of patients with focal frontal lobe lesions is a necessary first step in defining the relation of executive functions to the frontal lobes; (2) there is no unitary executive function. Rather, distinct processes related to the frontal lobes can be differentiated which converge on a general concept of control functions; (3) a simple control-automatic distinction is inadequate to explain the complexity of control-automatic processes; (4) the distinction between complex and simple tasks cannot explain the differences in functions between the frontal lobes and other brain regions; and (5) the most important role of the frontal lobes may be for affective responsiveness, social and personality development, and self-awareness and unconsciousness.},
